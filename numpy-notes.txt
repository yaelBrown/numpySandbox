NumPy
  Mathematics (MATLAB Replacement)
  Plotting (Matplotlib)
  Backend (Pandas, Connect 4, Digital Photography)
    Pandas is built on top NumPy
  Machine Learning (Directly and Indirectly)


Why use numpy over list
  Lists are slow
  Numpy is fast
    Uses fixed types
    uses less bytes of memory
    No type checking
    uses contiguous memory
      SIMD Vector Processing
        SIMD - "sim-d" Single Instruction Multiple Data
    Effective cache utilization
